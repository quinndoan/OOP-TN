Which classes are aggregates of other classes?

If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?
The comparison will return false.


Observe what happens and explain in detail(Polymorphism)

Reading Assignment: Please answer three questions below:
- What are the advantages of Polymorphism?
- How is Inheritance useful to achieve Polymorphism in Java?
- What are the differences between Polymorphism and Inheritance in Java?


Advantages of Polymorphism

1. Reuse code: By using polymorphism, we can write methods that can work with objects of multiple classes, which reduces redundancy and promotes code reusability.
2. Flexible and easy to extend: Polymorphism helps to create systems that are more flexible and easier to extend. For example, we can add new classes that implement existing interfaces or extend existing classes without modifying the existing code that uses those classes or interfaces.
3. Enhanced Readability: Polymorphic code tends to be more readable and easier to maintain because it promotes a higher level of abstraction.

How Inheritance is useful to achieve Polymorphism in Java:
In Java, inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass).
This relationship helps to achieve polymorphism because it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
This commonality enables polymorphic behavior, where methods defined in the superclass can be overridden in the subclass, allowing different implementations to be invoked dynamically at runtime.

Differences between Polymorphism and Inheritance in Java:


Questions about interface:
- What class should implement the Comparable interface?
- In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method to reflect the ordering that
we want?
- Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this
Comparable interface approach?
- Suppose the DVDs have a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then
decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
